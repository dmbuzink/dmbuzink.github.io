conditional state transitions to be defined based upon variables. \n                These variables can also be reassigned within the automaton. \n                After describing an automaton, an user can test some text on the automaton, to see if the automaton accepts the text.\n                This DSL was written in Rascal and compiles to Java.\n\n                </br> \n
